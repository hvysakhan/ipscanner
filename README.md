Simple tauri app to display pingable ip's of network along with MAC address.
# Usage
Make sure you've all dependencies of tauri installed. 

Getting mac address requires root privileges, otherwise the app crashes.

Also some ARP requests dont work for MAC Address, needs fixing.

```npm run tauri dev```

```npm run tauri build```
